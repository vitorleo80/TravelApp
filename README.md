When you go on holiday, you want to sightsee. You want to see all the best attractions your destination has to offer. And as everyone knows, if you want to find your way around, you just go to google maps. It's easy. 
But is it? Really? 

What if you just could just say: 
Here's where I want to stay. 
Here's ten places I want to go. 
I want visit maybe three per day. 
Tell me how. 
 - And everything - seeing which are close to which, dividing your choices into separate days and separate itineraries, telling you when you should set off and how long your day's travel will be - was calculated instantly and automatically. 

Introducing 'Tripster'. 
With Tripster you select a city you'd like to go to, and you get an immediate list of that city's attractions. You pick what you want to see, you pick where you're going to stay, and within seconds Tripster will generate a day-by-day layout of your holiday, showing you the best way to visit everything you want to visit and the travel time between each point.
